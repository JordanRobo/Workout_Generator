# 🏋️‍♂️ Workout Generator

## Because planning workouts is harder than doing them

Ever found yourself wanting to get fit but struggling with the trifecta of workout woes?

1. Gym memberships cost more than your coffee addiction
2. Planning workouts feels like rocket science
3. Routine is the enemy of motivation

Well, fear not! I've created this incredible C# console app to solve all these problems and more. Welcome to the Workout Generator, where fitness meets innovation.

## 🚀 Features

- Generates a "Workout of the Day" faster than you can say "I'll start on Monday"
- Emails your workout at 5am, because nothing says "good morning" like burpees
- Customisable exercises and workout schemas via a `data.json` file
- Hosted on DigitalOcean's App Platform, because even apps need a good home

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- C# (.NET 8) - Because we're not savages
- SMTP - For sneaking workouts into your inbox
- JSON - Keeping our data neat and tidy
- DigitalOcean App Platform - Hosting that's easier than a rest day

## 💡 Why This Exists

This app is my way of showcasing my C# skills while solving a real-world problem (for me anyway). It's proof that you can be both lazy and productive at the same time. Bill Gates would be proud.

## 🏃‍♂️ How It Works

1. The app wakes up at 5am, earlier than any of us want to
2. It randomly selects a workout schema and exercises from `data.json`
3. It crafts an email that's part workout plan, part motivation, all awesome
4. The email sneaks into your inbox, ready to inspire (or terrify) you when you wake up

## 🛠️ Setup

1. Clone this repo faster than you can do a jumping jack
2. Update `data.json` with your favorite (or least hated) exercises
3. Configure your email settings in `appsettings.json`
4. Deploy to DigitalOcean and watch the magic happen

## 🤔 Future Improvements

- Integration with fitness trackers (because manually logging workouts is so 2023)
- AI-powered workout recommendations (for when the app knows you better than you know yourself)
- Voice-activated complaints (for when typing "I'm too sore" is too much effort)

## 👨‍💻 About the Developer

I'm just a guy who decided that if computers can solve complex algorithms, they can surely tell me how many push-ups to do. When I'm not coding, I'm probably thinking about coding, or doing a workout that this app told me to do.

Remember, the only bad workout is the one that didn't happen. So let this app be your digital fitness buddy, personal trainer, and morning alarm all rolled into one. Happy sweating!
